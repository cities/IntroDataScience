# Version Control with Git

This section has been adapted from Software Carpentry lesson [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

## Readings

1. Software Carpentry [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).
1. Hadley Wickham [Git and Github](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html)

## Introduction

We'll start by exploring how version control can be used
to keep track of what one person did and when.
Even if you aren't collaborating with other people,
automated version control is much better than this situation:

[![Piled Higher and Deeper by Jorge Cham, http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1531](fig/phd101212s.png)](http://www.phdcomics.com)

"Piled Higher and Deeper" by Jorge Cham, http://www.phdcomics.com

We've all been in this situation before: it seems ridiculous to have
multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word
processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft
Word's [Track Changes](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Track-changes-in-Word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a) or Google Docs' [version
history](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en).

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and
then save just the changes you made at each step of the way. You can
think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base
document, then you can play back each change and end up with your
latest version.

![Changes Are Saved Sequentially](fig/play-changes.svg)

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you
can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes onto the
base document and getting different versions of the document. For
example, two users can make independent sets of changes based on the
same document.

![Different Versions Can be Saved](fig/versions.svg)

If there aren't conflicts, you can even play two sets of changes onto the same base document.

![Multiple Versions Can be Merged](fig/merge.svg)

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us and
helps us version and merge our files. It allows you to
decide which changes make up the next version, called a
[commit]({{ page.root }}/reference/#commit), and keeps useful metadata about them. The
complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up
a [repository]({{ page.root }}/reference/#repository). Repositories can be kept in sync
across different computers facilitating collaboration among different people.

> **The Long History of Version Control Systems**
>
> Automated version control systems are nothing new.
> Tools like RCS, CVS, or Subversion have been around since the early 1980s and are used by many large companies.
> However, many of these are now becoming considered as legacy systems due to various limitations in their capabilities.
> In particular, the more modern systems, such as Git and [Mercurial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/hg-novice/)
> are *distributed*, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository.
> These modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for multiple authors to work within
> the same files concurrently.


> **Paper Writing**

> *   Imagine you drafted an excellent paragraph for a paper you are writing, but later ruin it. How would you retrieve
>     the *excellent* version of your conclusion? Is it even possible?
>
> *   Imagine you have 5 co-authors. How would you manage the changes and comments they make to your paper?
>     If you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, what happens if you accept changes made using the

## Setting up Git

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples
of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

*   our name and email address,
*   to colorize our output,
*   what our preferred text editor is,
*   and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project)

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb`,
where `verb` is what we actually want to do. So here is how
Dracula sets up his new laptop:

```
$ git config --global user.name "Vlad Dracula"
$ git config --global user.email "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"
$ git config --global color.ui "auto"
```


Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's.
This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity,
which means that any changes pushed to
[GitHub](http://github.com/),
[BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org/),
[GitLab](http://gitlab.com/) or
another Git host server
in a later lesson will include this information.
If you are concerned about privacy, please review [GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private][git-privacy].

He also has to set his favorite text editor, following this table:

| Editor             | Configuration command                            |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
|Atom | `$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`|
| nano               | `$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`    |
| Text Wrangler (Mac)      | `$ git config --global core.editor "edit -w"`    |
| Sublime Text (Mac) | `$ git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 32-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 64-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Notepad++ (Win, 32-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Notepad++ (Win, 64-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Kate (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "kate"`       |
| Gedit (Linux)      | `$ git config --global core.editor "gedit --wait --new-window"`   |
| Scratch (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "scratch-text-editor"`  |
| emacs              | `$ git config --global core.editor "emacs"`   |
| vim                | `$ git config --global core.editor "vim"`   |

It is possible to reconfigure the text editor for Git whenever you want to change it.

> **Exiting Vim**
>
> Note that `vim` is the default editor for for many programs, if you haven't used `vim` before and wish to exit a session, type `Esc` then `:q!` and `Enter`.


The four commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git
to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

You can check your settings at any time:

```
$ git config --list
```


You can change your configuration as many times as you want: just use the
same commands to choose another editor or update your email address.

> **Proxy**
>
> In some networks you need to use a
> [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). If this is the case, you
> may also need to tell Git about the proxy:
>
> ```
> $ git config --global http.proxy proxy-url

> ```
> 
>
> To disable the proxy, use
>
> ```
> $ git config --global --unset http.proxy
> $ git config --global --unset https.proxy
> ```
>

>
> ```
> $ git config -h
> $ git config --help
> ```

## Creating a Repository

Once Git is configured,
we can start using it.
Let's create a directory for our work and then move into that directory:

```
$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
```


Then we tell Git to make `planets` a [repository]({{ page.root }}/reference/#repository)â€”a place where
Git can store versions of our files:

```
$ git init
```


If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents,
it appears that nothing has changed:

```
$ ls
```


But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `planets` called `.git`:

```
$ ls -a
```


```
.	..	.git
```


Git stores information about the project in this special sub-directory.
If we ever delete it,
we will lose the project's history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```
$ git status
```


```
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

> $ git init       # make the moons sub-directory a Git repository
> ```

## Tracking Changes

Let's create a file called `mars.txt` that contains some notes
about the Red Planet's suitability as a base.
(We'll use `nano` to edit the file;
you can use whatever editor you like.
In particular, this does not have to be the `core.editor` you set globally earlier.)

```
$ nano mars.txt
```


Type the text below into the `mars.txt` file:

```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
```


`mars.txt` now contains a single line, which we can see by running:

```
$ ls
```


```
mars.txt
```


```
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
```


If we check the status of our project again,
Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

```
$ git status
```


```
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	mars.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```


The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory
that Git isn't keeping track of.
We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

```
$ git add mars.txt
```


and then check that the right thing happened:

```
$ git status
```


```
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   mars.txt

```


Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `mars.txt`,
but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.
To get it to do that,
we need to run one more command:

```
$ git commit -m "Start notes on Mars as a base"
```


```
[master (root-commit) f22b25e] Start notes on Mars as a base
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt
```


When we run `git commit`,
Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a [commit]({{ page.root }}/reference/#commit)
(or [revision]({{ page.root }}/reference/#revision)) and its short identifier is `f22b25e`
(Your commit may have another identifier.)

We use the `-m` flag (for "message")
to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option,
Git will launch `nano` (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`)
so that we can write a longer message.

[Good commit messages][commit-messages] start with a brief (<50 characters) summary of
changes made in the commit.  If you want to go into more detail, add
a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes.

If we run `git status` now:

```
$ git status
```


```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```


it tells us everything is up to date.
If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

```
$ git log
```


```
commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b
Author: Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2013 -0400

    Start notes on Mars as a base
```


`git log` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

> **Where Are My Changes?**
>
> If we run `ls` at this point, we will still see just one file called `mars.txt`.
> That's because Git saves information about files' history
> in the special `.git` directory mentioned earlier
> so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered
> (and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).


Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file.
(Again, we'll edit with `nano` and then `cat` the file to show its contents;
you may use a different editor, and don't need to `cat`.)

```
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
```


When we run `git status` now,
it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

```
$ git status
```


```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```


The last line is the key phrase:
"no changes added to commit".
We have changed this file,
but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes
(which we do with `git add`)
nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`).
So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review
our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`.
This shows us the differences between the current state
of the file and the most recently saved version:

```
$ git diff
```


```
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
```


The output is cryptic because
it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch`
telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command
    comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file
    Git is comparing;
    `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4.  The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences
    and the lines on which they occur.
    In particular,
    the `+` marker in the first column shows where we added a line.

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

```
$ git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
$ git status
```


```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```


Whoops:
Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first.
Let's fix that:

```
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman"
```


```
[master 34961b1] Add concerns about effects of Mars' moons on Wolfman
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```


Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit
before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our
changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than
only large batches.
For example,
suppose we're adding a few citations to our supervisor's work
to our thesis.
We might want to commit those additions,
and the corresponding addition to the bibliography,
but *not* commit the work we're doing on the conclusion
(which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this,
Git has a special *staging area*
where it keeps track of things that have been added to
the current [change set]({{ page.root }}/reference/#change-set)
but not yet committed.

> **Staging Area**

> If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project,

> and `git commit` then *actually takes* the snapshot, and

![The Git Staging Area](fig/git-staging-area.svg)

Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor
to the staging area
and into long-term storage.
First,
we'll add another line to the file:

```
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
```


```
$ git diff
```


```

+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1,2 +1,3 @@

```


So far, so good:
we've added one line to the end of the file
(shown with a `+` in the first column).
Now let's put that change in the staging area
and see what `git diff` reports:

```
$ git add mars.txt
$ git diff
```


There is no output:
as far as Git can tell,
there's no difference between what it's been asked to save permanently
and what's currently in the directory.
However,
if we do this:

```
$ git diff --staged
```


```

it shows us the difference between

Let's save our changes:

```
$ git commit -m "Discuss concerns about Mars' climate for Mummy"

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`):

## Exploring History

As we saw in the previous lesson, we can refer to commits by their
identifiers.  You can refer to the _most recent commit_ of the working
directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding one line at a time to `mars.txt`, so it's easy to track our
progress by looking, so let's do that using our `HEAD`s.  Before we start,
let's make a change to `mars.txt`.

```
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
An ill-considered change
```


Now, let's see what we get.

```
$ git diff HEAD mars.txt
```


```
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index b36abfd..0848c8d 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
 The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
 But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
+An ill-considered change.
```


which is the same as what you would get if you leave out `HEAD` (try it).  The
real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits.  We do
that by adding `~1` to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`.

```
$ git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
```


If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:


```
$ git diff HEAD~2 mars.txt
```


```
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..b36abfd 100644

+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,3 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
+But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
```


We could also use `git show` which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as well as the commit message, rather than the _differences_ between a commit and our working directory that we see by using `git diff`.

```
$ git show HEAD~2 mars.txt
```


```

In this way,
we can build up a chain of commits.
The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1` (pronounced "head minus one")
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our first commit was given the ID
f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b,
so let's try this:

```
$ git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt
```


```
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt

+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,3 @@

That's the right answer,
but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying,
so Git lets us use just the first few characters:

```
$ git diff f22b25e mars.txt
```


```
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..b36abfd 100644

@@ -1 +1,3 @@

All right! So
we can save changes to files and see what we've changedâ€”now how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:

```
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
We will need to manufacture our own oxygen
```


`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

```
$ git status
```


```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```


We can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

```
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
```


As you might guess from its name,
`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file.
In this case,
we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`,
which is the last saved commit.
If we want to go back even further,
we can use a commit identifier instead:

```
$ git checkout f22b25e mars.txt
```


```
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
```


```
$ git status
```


```
# On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```


Notice that the changes are on the staged area.
Again, we can put things back the way they were with
by using `git checkout`:

```
$ git checkout -f master mars.txt
```

It's important to remember that
we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository
*before* the change we're trying to undo.
A common mistake is to use the number of
the commit in which we made the change we're trying to get rid of.
In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most
recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `f22b25e`:

![Git Checkout](fig/git-checkout.svg)

So, to put it all together,
here's how Git works in cartoon form:

The fact that files can be reverted one by one
tends to change the way people organize their work.
If everything is in one large document,
it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.

## Ignoring Things

What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us,
like backup files created by our editor
or intermediate files created during data analysis.
Let's create a few dummy files:

```
$ mkdir results
$ touch a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out
```


and see what Git says:

```
$ git status
```


```
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	a.dat
	b.dat
	c.dat
	results/
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```


Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space.
What's worse,
having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter,
so let's tell Git to ignore them.

We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`:

```
$ nano .gitignore
$ cat .gitignore
```


```
*.dat
results/
```


These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in `.dat`
and everything in the `results` directory.
(If any of these files were already being tracked,
Git would continue to track them.)

Once we have created this file,
the output of `git status` is much cleaner:

```
$ git status
```


```
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.gitignore
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```


The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created `.gitignore` file.
You might think we wouldn't want to track it,
but everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore
the same things that we're ignoring.
Let's add and commit `.gitignore`:

```
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m "Add the ignore file"
$ git status
```


```
# On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```


As a bonus, using `.gitignore` helps us avoid accidentally adding to the repository files that we don't want to track:

```
$ git add a.dat
```


```
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
a.dat
Use -f if you really want to add them.
```


If we really want to override our ignore settings,
we can use `git add -f` to force Git to add something. For example,
`git add -f a.dat`.
We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:

```
$ git status --ignored
```


```
On branch master
Ignored files:
 (use "git add -f <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        a.dat
        b.dat
        c.dat
        results/

nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

## Remotes in GitHub

Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with
other people.  We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the
only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.

Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories.  In
practice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it
on the web rather than on someone's laptop.  Most programmers use hosting
services like [GitHub](http://github.com), [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org) or
[GitLab](http://gitlab.com/) to hold those master copies; we'll explore the pros
and cons of this in the final section of this lesson.

Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the
world.  Log in to GitHub, then click on the icon in the top right corner to
create a new repository called `planets`:

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)](fig/github-create-repo-01.png)

Name your repository "planets" and then click "Create Repository":

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)](fig/github-create-repo-02.png)

As soon as the repository is created, GitHub displays a page with a URL and some
information on how to configure your local repository:

![Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 3)](fig/github-create-repo-03.png)

This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:

```
$ mkdir planets
$ cd planets
$ git init
```


Our local repository still contains our earlier work on `mars.txt`, but the
remote repository on GitHub doesn't contain any files yet:

![Freshly-Made GitHub Repository](fig/git-freshly-made-github-repo.svg)

The next step is to connect the two repositories.  We do this by making the
GitHub repository a [remote]({{ page.root }}/reference/#remote) for the local repository.
The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to
identify it:

![Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub](fig/github-find-repo-string.png)

Click on the 'HTTPS' link to change the [protocol]({{ page.root }}/reference/#protocol) from
SSH to HTTPS.

> **HTTPS vs. SSH**
>
> We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration.  After
> the workshop you may want to set up SSH access, which is a bit more secure, by
> following one of the great tutorials from
> [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys),
> [Atlassian/BitBucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git)
> and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/03/04/add-ssh-key-screencast/)
> (this one has a screencast).


![Changing the Repository URL on GitHub](fig/github-change-repo-string.png)

Copy that URL from the browser, go into the local `planets` repository, and run
this command:

```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
```


Make sure to use the URL for your repository rather than Vlad's: the only
difference should be your username instead of `vlad`.

We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`:

```
$ git remote -v
```


```
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (push)
origin   https://github.com/vlad/planets.git (fetch)
```


The name `origin` is a local nickname for your remote repository. We could use
something else if we wanted to, but `origin` is by far the most common choice.

Once the nickname `origin` is set up, this command will push the changes from
our local repository to the repository on GitHub:

```
$ git push origin master
```


```
Counting objects: 9, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (9/9), 821 bytes, done.
Total 9 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
```


> **Proxy**
>
> If the network you are connected to uses a proxy there is an chance that your
> last command failed with "Could not resolve hostname" as the error message. To
> solve this issue you need to tell Git about the proxy:
>
> ```
> $ git config --global http.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
> $ git config --global https.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
> ```
> 
>
> When you connect to another network that doesn't use a proxy you will need to
> tell Git to disable the proxy using:
>
> ```
> $ git config --global --unset http.proxy
> $ git config --global --unset https.proxy
> ```
> 


> **Password Managers**
>
> If your operating system has a password manager configured, `git push` will
> try to use it when it needs your username and password.  For example, this
> is the default behavior for Git Bash on Windows. If you want to type your
> username and password at the terminal instead of using a password manager,
> type:
>
> ```
> $ unset SSH_ASKPASS
> ```
> 
>
> in the terminal, before you run `git push`.  Despite the name, [git uses
> `SSH_ASKPASS` for all credential
> entry](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials#_requesting_credentials), so
> you may want to unset `SSH_ASKPASS` whether you are using git via SSH or
> https.
>
> You may also want to add `unset SSH_ASKPASS` at the end of your `~/.bashrc`
> to make git default to using the terminal for usernames and passwords.


Our local and remote repositories are now in this state:

![GitHub Repository After First Push](fig/github-repo-after-first-push.svg)

> **The '-u' Flag**
>
> You may see a `-u` option used with `git push` in some documentation.  This
> option is synonymous with the `--set-upstream-to` option for the `git branch`
> command, and is used to associate the current branch with a remote branch so
> that the `git pull` command can be used without any arguments. To do this,
> simply use `git push -u origin master` once the remote has been set up.


We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

```
$ git pull origin master
```


```
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
```


Pulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already
synchronized.  If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on
GitHub, though, this command would download them to our local repository.

> **GitHub GUI**
>
> Browse to your `planets` repository on GitHub.
> Under the Code tab, find and click on the text that says "XX commits" (where "XX" is some number).
> Hover over, and click on, the three buttons to the right of each commit.
> What information can you gather/explore from these buttons?
> How would you get that same information in the shell?
>
<!-- > > ## Solution -->
<!-- > > The left-most button (with the picture of a clipboard) copies the full identifier of the commit to the clipboard. In the shell, ```git log``` will show you the full commit identifier for each commit. -->
<!-- > > -->
<!-- > > When you click on the middle button, you'll see all of the changes that were made in that particular commit. Green shaded lines indicate additions and red ones removals. In the shell we can do the same thing with ```git diff```. In particular, ```git diff ID1..ID2``` where ID1 and ID2 are commit identifiers (e.g. ```git diff a3bf1e5..041e637```) will show the differences between those two commits. -->
<!-- > > -->
<!-- > > The right-most button lets you view all of the files in the repository at the time of that commit. To do this in the shell, we'd need to checkout the repository at that particular time. We can do this with ```git checkout ID``` where ID is the identifier of the commit we want to look at. If we do this, we need to remember to put the repository back to the right state afterwards! -->
<!-- >  -->


> **GitHub Timestamp**
>
> Create a remote repository on GitHub.  Push the contents of your local
> repository to the remote.  Make changes to your local repository and push
> these changes.  Go to the repo you just created on GitHub and check the
> [timestamps]({{ page.root }}/reference/#timestamp) of the files.  How does GitHub record
> times, and why?
>
<!-- > > ## Solution -->
<!-- > > Github displays timestamps in a human readable relative format (i.e. "22 hours ago" or "three weeks ago"). However, if you hover over the timestamp, you can see the exact time at which the last change to the file occurred. -->
<!-- >  -->


> **Push vs. Commit**
>
> In this lesson, we introduced the "git push" command.
> How is "git push" different from "git commit"?
>
<!-- > > ## Solution -->
<!-- > > When we push changes, we're interacting with a remote repository to update it with the changes we've made locally (often this corresponds to sharing the changes we've made with others). Commit only updates your local repository. -->
<!-- >  -->


> **Fixing Remote Settings**
>
> It happens quite often in practice that you made a typo in the
> remote URL. This exercice is about how to fix this kind of issues.
> First start by adding a remote with an invalid URL:
>
> ```
> git remote add broken https://github.com/this/url/is/invalid
> ```
> 
>
> Do you get an error when adding the remote? Can you think of a
> command that would make it obvious that your remote URL was not
> valid? Can you figure out how to fix the URL (tip: use `git remote
> -h`)? Don't forget to clean up and remove this remote once you are
> done with this exercise.
>
<!-- > > ## Solution -->
<!-- > > We don't see any error message when we add the remote (adding the remote tells git about it, but doesn't try to use it yet). As soon as we try to use ```git push``` we'll see an error message. The command ```git remote set-url``` allows us to change the remote's URL to fix it. -->
<!-- >  -->


> **GitHub License and README files**
>
> In this section we learned about creating a remote repository on GitHub, but when you initialized your
> GitHub repo, you didn't add a README.md or a license file. If you had, what do you think would have happened when
> you tried to link your local and remote repositories?
>
<!-- > > ## Solution -->
<!-- > > In this case, since we already had a README file in our own (local) repository, we'd see a merge conflict (when git realises that there are two versions of the file and asks us to reconcile the differences). -->
<!-- >  -->


## Collaborating

For the next step, get into pairs.  One person will be the "Owner" and the other
will be the "Collaborator". The goal is that the Collaborator add changes into
the Owner's repository. We will switch roles at the end, so both persons will
play Owner and Collaborator.

> **Practicing By Yourself**
>
> If you're working through this lesson on your own, you can carry on by opening
> a second terminal window.
> This window will represent your partner, working on another computer. You
> won't need to give anyone access on GitHub, because both 'partners' are you.


The Owner needs to give the Collaborator access.
On GitHub, click the settings button on the right,
then select Collaborators, and enter your partner's username.

![Adding Collaborators on GitHub](fig/github-add-collaborators.png)

To accept access to the Owner's repo, the Collaborator
needs to go to [https://github.com/notifications](https://github.com/notifications).
Once there she can accept access to the Owner's repo.

Next, the Collaborator needs to download a copy of the Owner's repository to her
 machine. This is called "cloning a repo". To clone the Owner's repo into
her `Desktop` folder, the Collaborator enters:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vlad/planets.git ~/Desktop/vlad-planets
```


Replace 'vlad' with the Owner's username.

![After Creating Clone of Repository](fig/github-collaboration.svg)

The Collaborator can now make a change in her clone of the Owner's repository,
exactly the same way as we've been doing before:

```
$ cd ~/Desktop/vlad-planets
$ nano pluto.txt
$ cat pluto.txt
```


```
It is so a planet!
```


```
$ git add pluto.txt
$ git commit -m "Some notes about Pluto"
```


```
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 pluto.txt
```


Then push the change to the *Owner's repository* on GitHub:

```
$ git push origin master
```


```
Counting objects: 4, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 306 bytes, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
   9272da5..29aba7c  master -> master
```


Note that we didn't have to create a remote called `origin`: Git uses this
name by default when we clone a repository.  (This is why `origin` was a
sensible choice earlier when we were setting up remotes by hand.)

Take a look to the Owner's repository on its GitHub website now (maybe you need
to refresh your browser.) You should be able to see the new commit made by the
Collaborator.

To download the Collaborator's changes from GitHub, the Owner now enters:

```
$ git pull origin master
```


```
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

Updating 9272da5..29aba7c
Fast-forward
 pluto.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 pluto.txt
```


Now the three repositories (Owner's local, Collaborator's local, and Owner's on
GitHub) are back in sync.

> **A Basic Collaborative Workflow**
>
> In practice, it is good to be sure that you have an updated version of the
> repository you are collaborating on, so you should `git pull` before making
> our changes. The basic collaborative workflow would be:
>
> * update your local repo with `git pull origin master`,
> * make your changes and stage them with `git add`,
> * commit your changes with `git commit -m`, and
> * upload the changes to GitHub with `git push origin master`
>
> It is better to make many commits with smaller changes rather than
> of one commit with massive changes: small commits are easier to
> read and review.


> **Switch Roles and Repeat**
>
> Switch roles and repeat the whole process.


> **Review Changes**
>
> The Owner push commits to the repository without giving any information
> to the Collaborator. How can the Collaborator find out what has changed with
> command line? And on GitHub?


> **Comment Changes in GitHub**
>
> The Collaborator has some questions about one line change made by the Owner and
> has some suggestions to propose.
>
> With GitHub, it is possible to comment the diff of a commit. Over the line of
> code to comment, a blue comment icon appears to open a comment window.
>
> The Collaborator posts its comments and suggestions using GitHub interface.


> **Version History, Backup, and Version Control**
>
> Some backup software can keep a history of the versions of your files. They also
> allows you to recover specific versions. How is this functionality different from version control?
> What are some of the benifits of using version control, Git and GitHub?


## Conflicts

As soon as people can work in parallel, it's likely someone's going to step on someone
else's toes.  This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on
a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make
different changes to each copy.  Version control helps us manage these
[conflicts]({{ page.root }}/reference/#conflicts) by giving us tools to
[resolve]({{ page.root }}/reference/#resolve) overlapping changes.

To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one.  The file
`mars.txt` currently looks like this in both partners' copies of our `planets`
repository:

```
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
```


Let's add a line to one partner's copy only:

```
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
This line added to Wolfman's copy
```


and then push the change to GitHub:

```
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Adding a line in our home copy"
```


```
[master 5ae9631] Adding a line in our home copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```


```
$ git push origin master
```


```
Counting objects: 5, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 352 bytes, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/vlad/planets
   29aba7c..dabb4c8  master -> master
```


Now let's have the other partner
make a different change to their copy
*without* updating from GitHub:

```
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We added a different line in the other copy
```


We can commit the change locally:

```
$ git add mars.txt
$ git commit -m "Adding a line in my copy"
```


```
[master 07ebc69] Adding a line in my copy
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```


but Git won't let us push it to GitHub:

```
$ git push origin master
```


```
To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)

hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```


![The Conflicting Changes](fig/conflict.svg)

Git detects that the changes made in one copy overlap with those made in the other
and stops us from trampling on our previous work.
What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub,
[merge]({{ page.root }}/reference/#merge) them into the copy we're currently working in,
and then push that.
Let's start by pulling:

```
$ git pull origin master
```


```
remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging mars.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in mars.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```


`git pull` tells us there's a conflict,
and marks that conflict in the affected file:

```
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
<<<<<<< HEAD
We added a different line in the other copy
=======
This line added to Wolfman's copy
>>>>>>> dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d
```


Our changeâ€”the one in `HEAD`â€”is preceded by `<<<<<<<`.
Git has then inserted `=======` as a separator between the conflicting changes
and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with `>>>>>>>`.
(The string of letters and digits after that marker
identifies the commit we've just downloaded.)

It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers
and reconcile the changes.
We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep
the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both,
or get rid of the change entirely.
Let's replace both so that the file looks like this:

```
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line
```


To finish merging,
we add `mars.txt` to the changes being made by the merge
and then commit:

```
$ git add mars.txt
$ git status
```


```
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

	modified:   mars.txt

```


```
$ git commit -m "Merging changes from GitHub"
```


```
[master 2abf2b1] Merging changes from GitHub
```


Now we can push our changes to GitHub:

```
$ git push origin master
```


```
Counting objects: 10, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.

To https://github.com/vlad/planets.git
   dabb4c8..2abf2b1  master -> master
```


Git keeps track of what we've merged with what,
so we don't have to fix things by hand again
when the collaborator who made the first change pulls again:

```
$ git pull origin master
```


```
remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 2), reused 6 (delta 2)

 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```


We get the merged file:

```
$ cat mars.txt
```


```
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
We removed the conflict on this line
```


We don't need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.

Git's ability to resolve conflicts is very useful, but conflict resolution
costs time and effort, and can introduce errors if conflicts are not resolved
correctly. If you find yourself resolving a lot of conflicts in a project,
consider one of these approaches to reducing them:

- Try breaking large files apart into smaller files so that it is less
  likely that two authors will be working in the same file at the same time
- Clarify who is responsible for what areas with your collaborators
- Discuss what order tasks should be carried out in with your collaborators so
  that tasks that will change the same file won't be worked on at the same time

## Open Science

> The opposite of "open" isn't "closed".
> The opposite of "open" is "broken".
>
> --- John Wilbanks


Free sharing of information might be the ideal in science,
but the reality is often more complicated.
Normal practice today looks something like this:

*   A scientist collects some data and stores it on a machine
    that is occasionally backed up by her department.
*   She then writes or modifies a few small programs
    (which also reside on her machine)
    to analyze that data.
*   Once she has some results,
    she writes them up and submits her paper.
    She might include her dataâ€”a growing number of journals require thisâ€”but
    she probably doesn't include her code.
*   Time passes.
*   The journal sends her reviews written anonymously by a handful of other people in her field.
    She revises her paper to satisfy them,
    during which time she might also modify the scripts she wrote earlier,
    and resubmits.
*   More time passes.
*   The paper is eventually published.
    It might include a link to an online copy of her data,
    but the paper itself will be behind a paywall:
    only people who have personal or institutional access
    will be able to read it.

For a growing number of scientists,
though,
the process looks like this:

*   The data that the scientist collects is stored in an open access repository
    like [figshare](http://figshare.com/) or
    [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org), possibly as soon as it's collected,
    and given its own
    [Digital Object Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) (DOI).
    Or the data was already published and is stored in
    [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/).
*   The scientist creates a new repository on GitHub to hold her work.
*   As she does her analysis,
    she pushes changes to her scripts
    (and possibly some output files)
    to that repository.
    She also uses the repository for her paper;
    that repository is then the hub for collaboration with her colleagues.
*   When she's happy with the state of her paper,
    she posts a version to [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/)
    or some other preprint server
    to invite feedback from peers.
*   Based on that feedback,
    she may post several revisions
    before finally submitting her paper to a journal.
*   The published paper includes links to her preprint
    and to her code and data repositories,
    which  makes it much easier for other scientists
    to use her work as starting point for their own research.

This open model accelerates discovery:
the more open work is,
[the more widely it is cited and re-used](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308).
However,
people who want to work this way need to make some decisions
about what exactly "open" means and how to do it. You can find more on the different aspects of Open Science in [this book](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8).

This is one of the (many) reasons we teach version control.
When used diligently,
it answers the "how" question
by acting as a shareable electronic lab notebook for computational work:

*   The conceptual stages of your work are documented, including who did
    what and when. Every step is stamped with an identifier (the commit ID)
    that is for most intents and purposes unique.
*   You can tie documentation of rationale, ideas, and other
    intellectual work directly to the changes that spring from them.
*   You can refer to what you used in your research to obtain your
    computational results in a way that is unique and recoverable.
*   With a distributed version control system such as Git, the version
    control repository is easy to archive for perpetuity, and contains
    the entire history.

## Licensing

When a repository with source code, a manuscript or other creative
works becomes public, it should include a file `LICENSE` or
`LICENSE.txt` in the base directory of the repository that clearly
states under which license the content is being made available. This
is because creative works are automatically eligible for intellectual
property (and thus copyright) protection. Reusing creative works
without a license is dangerous, because the copyright holders could
sue you for copyright infringement.

A license solves this problem by granting rights to others (the
licensees) that they would otherwise not have. What rights are being
granted under which conditions differs, often only slightly, from one
license to another. In practice, a few licenses are by far the most
popular, and [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/) will
help you find a common license that suits your needs.  Important
considerations include:

* Whether you want to address patent rights.
* Whether you require people distributing derivative works to also
  distribute their source code.
* Whether the content you are licensing is source code.
* Whether you want to license the code at all.

Choosing a licence that is in common use makes life easier for
contributors and users, because they are more likely to already be
familiar with the license and don't have to wade through a bunch of
jargon to decide if they're ok with it.  The [Open Source
Inititative](http://opensource.org/licenses) and [Free Software
Foundation](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) both
maintain lists of licenses which are good choices.

[This article][software-licensing] provides an excellent overview of
licensing and licensing options from the perspective of scientists who
also write code.

At the end of the day what matters is that there is a clear statement
as to what the license is. Also, the license is best chosen from the
get-go, even if for a repository that is not public. Pushing off the
decision only makes it more complicated later, because each time a new
collaborator starts contributing, they, too, hold copyright and will
thus need to be asked for approval once a license is chosen.

> Find out whether you are allowed to apply an open license to your software.

> or do you need permission from someone in your institution?

## Citation
You may want to include a file called `CITATION` or `CITATION.txt`
that describes how to reference your project;
the [one for Software
Carpentry](https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/blob/gh-pages/CITATION)
states:

```
To reference Software Carpentry in publications, please cite both of the following:

Greg Wilson: "Software Carpentry: Getting Scientists to Write Better
Code by Making Them More Productive".  Computing in Science &
Engineering, Nov-Dec 2006.

}
```


## Hosting

The second big question for groups that want to open up their work is where to
host their code and data.  One option is for the lab, the department, or the
university to provide a server, manage accounts and backups, and so on.  The
main benefit of this is that it clarifies who owns what, which is particularly
important if any of the material is sensitive (i.e., relates to experiments
involving human subjects or may be used in a patent application).  The main
drawbacks are the cost of providing the service and its longevity: a scientist
who has spent ten years collecting data would like to be sure that data will
still be available ten years from now, but that's well beyond the lifespan of
most of the grants that fund academic infrastructure.

Another option is to purchase a domain and pay an Internet service provider
(ISP) to host it.  This gives the individual or group more control, and
sidesteps problems that can arise when moving from one institution to another,
but requires more time and effort to set up than either the option above or the
option below.

The third option is to use a public hosting service like
[GitHub](http://github.com), [GitLab](http://gitlab.com),
[BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org), or [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net).
Each of these services provides a web interface that enables people to create,
view, and edit their code repositories.  These services also provide
communication and project management tools including issue tracking, wiki pages,
email notifications, and code reviews.  These services benefit from economies of
scale and network effects: it's easier to run one large service well than to run
many smaller services to the same standard.  It's also easier for people to
collaborate.  Using a popular service can help connect your project with
communities already using the same service.

As an example, Software Carpentry [is on
GitHub]({{ swc_github }}) where you can find the [source for this
page]({{page.root}}/_episodes/13-hosting.md).
Anyone with a GitHub account can suggest changes to this text.

Using large, well-established services can also help you quickly take advantage
of powerful tools.  One such tool, continuous integration (CI), can
automatically run software builds and tests whenever code is committed or pull
requests are submitted.  Direct integration of CI with an online hosting service
means this information is present in any pull request, and helps maintain code
integrity and quality standards.  While CI is still available in self-hosted
situations, there is much less setup and maintenance involved with using an
online service.  Furthermore, such tools are often provided free of charge to
open source projects, and are also available for private repositories for a fee.

## Using Git from RStudio

Since version control is so useful when developing scripts, RStudio has built-in
integration with Git. There are some more obscure Git features that you still
need to use the command-line for, but RStudio has a nice interface for most
common operations.

RStudio let's you create a [project][rstudio-projects] associated with
a given directory. This is a way to keep track of related files. One
of the way to keep track of them is via version control! To get
started using RStudio for version control, let's make a new project:

![](fig/RStudio_screenshot_newproject.png)

This will pop up a window asking us how we want to create the project. We have
some options here. Let's say that we want to use RStudio with the planets
repository that we already made. Since that repository lives in a directory on
our computer, we'll choose "existing directory":

![](fig/RStudio_screenshot_existingdirectory.png)

> **Do You See a "Version Control" Option?**
>
> Although we're not going to use it here, there should be a "version control"
> option on this menu. That is what you would click on if you wanted to
> create a project on your computer by cloning a repository from github.
> If that option is not present, it probably means that RStudio doesn't know
> where your Git executable is. See
> [this page](https://stat545-ubc.github.io/git03_rstudio-meet-git.html)
> for some debugging advice. Even if you have Git installed, you may need
> to accept the XCode license if you are using MacOSX.


Next, RStudio will ask which existing directory we want to use. Click "browse"
to navigate to the correct directory on your computer, then click "create
project":

![](fig/RStudio_screenshot_navigateexisting.png)

Ta-da! Now you have an R project containing your repository. Notice the
vertical "Git" menu that is now on the menu bar. This means RStudio has
recognized that this directory is a git repository, so it's giving you tools
to use Git:

![](fig/RStudio_screenshot_afterclone.png)

To edit the files in your repository, you can click on them from the panel in
the lower right. Let's add some more information about pluto:

![](fig/RStudio_screenshot_editfiles.png)

We can also use RStudio to commit these changes. Go to the git menu and click
"commit":

![](fig/RStudio_screenshot_commit.png)

This will bring up a screen where you can select which files to commit (check
the boxes in the "staged" column) and enter a commit message (in the upper
right). The icons in the "status" column indicate the current status of each
file. You can also see the changes to each file by clicking on its name. Once
everything is the way you want it, click "commit":

![](fig/RStudio_screenshot_review.png)

You can push these changes by selecting "push" from the Git menu. There are
also options there to pull from a remote version of the repository, and view
the history:

![](fig/RStudio_screenshot_history.png)

> **Are the Push/Pull Commands Grayed Out?**
>
> If this is the case, it generally means that RStudio doesn't know the
> location of any other version of your repository (i.e. the one on GitHub).
> To fix this, open a terminal to the repository and enter the command:
> `git push -u origin master`. Then restart RStudio.


If we click on "history", we can see a pretty graphical version of what
`git log` would tell us:

![](fig/RStudio_screenshot_viewhistory.png)

RStudio creates some files that is uses to keep track of your project. You
generally don't want to track these, so adding them to your .gitignore file
is a good idea:

![](fig/RStudio_screenshot_gitignore.png)

There are many more features buried in the RStudio git interface, but these
should be enough to get you started!
