### Tidy data

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

- Each variable must have its own column.
- Each observation must have its own row.
- Each value must have its own cell.

These three rules are interrelated because it’s impossible to only satisfy two of the three. That interrelationship leads to an even simpler set of practical instructions:

- Put each dataset in a tibble.
- Put each variable in a column.

In this example, only table1 is tidy. It’s the only representation where each column is a variable.

Why ensure that your data is tidy? There are two main advantages:

1. There’s a general advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. If you have a consistent data structure, it’s easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.

2. There’s a specific advantage to placing variables in columns because it allows R’s vectorised nature to shine. As you learned in mutate and summary functions, most built-in R functions work with vectors of values. That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural.
